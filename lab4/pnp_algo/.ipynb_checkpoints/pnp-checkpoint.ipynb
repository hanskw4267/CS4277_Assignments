    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this part, you will get to estimate the rotation and translation of a camera by using the linear n-point camera pose determination algorithm. As discussed in the lecture, You will need at least four 2d-to-3d correspondencs to get a unique solution. We will provide ten 2d-to-3d correspondences and the camera intrinsics in the dataset. \n",

    "**Honour Code**. The coding assignment (Lab4-1 and Lab4-2) constitutes 10% of your final grade in CS4277/CS5477. Note that plagiarism will not be condoned! You may discuss with your classmates and check the internet for references, but you MUST NOT submit code/report that is copied directly from other sources!\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "This workbook provides the instructions for the assignment, and facilitates the running of your code and visualization of the results. For each part of the assignment, you are required to **complete the implementations of certain functions in the accompanying python file** (`pnp.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate implementation and grading, all your work is to be done in that file, and **you only have to submit the .py file**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note the following:\n",
    "1. Fill in your name, email, and NUSNET ID at the top of the python file.\n",
    "2. The parts you need to implement are clearly marked with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \"\"\" YOUR CODE STARTS HERE \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\"\" YOUR CODE ENDS HERE \"\"\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    , and you should write your code in between the above two lines.\n",
    "3. Note that for each part, there may certain functions that are prohibited to be used. It is important **NOT to use those prohibited functions** (or other functions with similar functionality). If you are unsure whether a particular function is allowed, feel free to ask any of the TAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "Items to be submitted:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tSource code (eight_point.py and pnp.py). These are where you fill in all your codes for each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tReport (report.pdf). This should describe your implementation and be no more than one page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please clearly indicate your name and student number (the one that looks like A1234567X) in the report as well as the top of your source code. Zip the three files together and name it in the following format: A1234567X_lab4.zip (replace with your student number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your assignment by 23 March 2021, 2359HRS to LumiNUS. 25% of the total score will be deducted for each day of late submission."
